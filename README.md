# FSDI 114 - Data Structure and Algorithms

Class 1
Start with QA about previous courses and then start creating a folder called FSDI_114
- clear console
- mkdir FSDI_114
- cd FSDI_114
- python3 -m venv venv
- Activate venv (source venv/bin/activate)
- Install jupyter notebook (pip3 install jupyter)
- Open jupyter (python3 -m notebook)
- Open vscode and create a new ipynb file
- Select the required kernel
- follow class_1.ipynb
- follow youtube video 
    - Asked about if they catched the problem?
    - ask about subjective vs objective
    - do you think with the statement given could you solve the problem?
- Solve problem: Imagine you're next to a river and it's your job to collect 6 quarts of water from the river. To do that you only have 2 containers: 1 of them can hold up to 9 quarts of water and the other can hold up to 4 quarts of water. How do you solve it?
- 15 min break
- AAA Aproach
    - Assessment: We want to ask meaningful questions with the purpose of clarifying incorrect asumptions, edge cases we might have missed and specific criteria we do not know up front
    - Assembly: We want to design a solution by defining data structures, selecting or defining an algorithm and tryion to solve the problem as optimally as possible.
    - Action: Code.
- Solve anagram problem and if time write it on pseudocode.
